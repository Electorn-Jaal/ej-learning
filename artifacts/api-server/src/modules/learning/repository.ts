 * The lesson a student's class is scheduled for on one day.
 *
 * The class comes from the student's own enrolment, so the student id decides
 * what is returned and nothing else can be asked for.
 *
 * The book reference is a LEFT JOIN: a lesson without an aligned chapter is
 * still a lesson. It walks skill -> content_skill_maps -> content_nodes ->
 * content_source_alignments, preferring the primary mapping, which is the same
 * path the remediation walk will use once diagnostics exist.
